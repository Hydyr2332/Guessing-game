# Guessing-game
This is my first project, if I made any mistakes contact me via email. (To find my email go to the profile) The game is called Guess the Number. In it the user must guess the number given by the computer. The game has a meaningless points system, also hints depending on the number of attempts. Points are deducted for each option offered by the user. The game stops when the user either guesses the number or runs out of points.
